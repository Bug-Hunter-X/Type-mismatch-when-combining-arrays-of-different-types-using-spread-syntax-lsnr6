This example demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript when combining arrays of different types using the spread syntax.  The `combineArrays` function attempts to combine two arrays, but the type inference fails because the arrays contain different types (numbers and strings). The solution involves using a generic type parameter to allow the function to accept arrays of any type, or using type assertions to explicitly specify the type of the combined array.
